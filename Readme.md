## Sentiment and Cluster Analysis of Headspace App User Review

**Background and Objective:**

Qualitative research provides in-depth user insights which helps in understanding of reasons, opinions, motivations, and underlying meanings. It helps in unearthing insights which are often missed in qualitative research. However due to nature of data common statistical approach canâ€™t be easily applied to qualitative data and therefore it is time consuming to analyze, and be dependent on interpretation and biases of researchers.

Sentiment Analysis and Clustering techniques makes it a lot easier in analyzing qualitative data and developing insights. By using statistical machine learning techniques we can reduce interpretation biases, and make the analysis more data informed.

Following code downloads 2000 user reviews for Headspace App on Apple App Store and Google Play store. The code uses machine learning to do sentiment analysis on user reviews and creates clusters. The code then does some exploratory data analysis for each of the cluster.

This helps us in identifying common themes across cluster and develop insights which can be used to improve user experience and consequently improve life time value of the users.
